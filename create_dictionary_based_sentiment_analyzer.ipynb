All it does in this direction (blocking certain optical and virtual drives) is a very old, lame and already bypassed attempt that serves as a thin smoke-screen. SecuROM is, in fact, an intruding and silent Data-Miner and Root-Hijacker that is delivered by means of popular games.\n",

The graphics where that of a xbox original, i am not joking they are some of the WORST graphics i have seen in a long time. NOT only are the graphics bad but the game play is not much better. Besides the fact that when you walk you look like you have something rather large in your butt making your player look VERY stiff, and has for the story, WAIT there was a story here??? well if there was anything to do with a story then i must have missed it, the so called story here is not at ALL good in fact it was just pain boring and luckily for me was VERY short beating it in under 2 hours. Ok now on to the level design, well lets just say that it was some of the worst i have seen. It goes like this, run into to dark boring room shoot a few bad guys or zombies then move to the next room that looks almost the same then repeat and do again for the next few hours. Ok so now i will move to the sound of the game, so the zombies when you kill them it sounds OK at best, but as for the sound of the guns WOW OMFG the worst EVER sounds weaker then a nerf guns!!!! the voice overs are very bad as well. Ok now onto the only kind of fun in this game, the only time i had ANY fun on this game was when i played with friends, but even still it was very boring. There is a ranking system that is mediocre at best, the more enemy's you kill the more XP you will get, and when you earn XP you can buy guns that won't really care to use because they all for the most part suck, or you can buy powers for the different players you can choose from. I would also like to add in the fact that when i you enemy it is almost completely random as to when they die, sometimes it will only take a few shoots to kill a simple solder and other time the same kind of enemy will take a clip and a half to kill, as well as that but the hit indication is very OFF. So i will wrap this up by saying this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, rent it first to see for yourself. i hope someone can find fun in this game, but for me i could not find much fun here.\n",
            "\n",
            "I forgot to add in here that the AI IS THE WORST IN ANY GAME EVER. your team mates make no attempt whatsoever to avoid danger or even bother to shoot at the enemy, your friendly AI will spend the bulk of their time wasting ammo on a wall or ceiling if they are even shooting at ALL, the rest of the time they are just in your way block you in doorways or blocking your shots, never before have i ever seen AI worse than this. As for the enemy AI they are just as bad, half the time the enemy is just standing there as i am shooting them.\n",

            "well let me start by saying that when i first started this game up i was so excited, but when i started playing OMG was i pissed off. The graphics where that of a xbox original, i am not joking they are some of the WORST graphics i have seen in a long time. NOT only are the graphics bad but the game play is not much better. Besides the fact that when you walk you look like you have something rather large in your butt making your player look VERY stiff, and has for the story, WAIT there was a story here??? well if there was anything to do with a story then i must have missed it, the so called story here is not at ALL good in fact it was just pain boring and luckily for me was VERY short beating it in under 2 hours. Ok now on to the level design, well lets just say that it was some of the worst i have seen. It goes like this, run into to dark boring room shoot a few bad guys or zombies then move to the next room that looks almost the same then repeat and do again for the next few hours. Ok so now i will move to the sound of the game, so the zombies when you kill them it sounds OK at best, but as for the sound of the guns WOW OMFG the worst EVER sounds weaker then a nerf guns!!!! the voice overs are very bad as well. Ok now onto the only kind of fun in this game, the only time i had ANY fun on this game was when i played with friends, but even still it was very boring. There is a ranking system that is mediocre at best, the more enemy's you kill the more XP you will get, and when you earn XP you can buy guns that won't really care to use because they all for the most part suck, or you can buy powers for the different players you can choose from. I would also like to add in the fact that when i you enemy it is almost completely random as to when they die, sometimes it will only take a few shoots to kill a simple solder and other time the same kind of enemy will take a clip and a half to kill, as well as that but the hit indication is very OFF. So i will wrap this up by saying this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, rent it first to see for yourself. i hope someone can find fun in this game, but for me i could not find much fun here.\n",
            "\n",
            "I forgot to add in here that the AI IS THE WORST IN ANY GAME EVER. your team mates make no attempt whatsoever to avoid danger or even bother to shoot at the enemy, your friendly AI will spend the bulk of their time wasting ammo on a wall or ceiling if they are even shooting at ALL, the rest of the time they are just in your way block you in doorways or blocking your shots, never before have i ever seen AI worse than this. As for the enemy AI they are just as bad, half the time the enemy is just standing there as i am shooting them.\n",
